SciPy

## Proposal Title:

To improve the accessibility of SciPy for Spanish-speaking users, we would
like to translate its main website into Spanish.

## Two Sentence Summary of Proposal:

## Description of Proposal:

<!-- No more than 750 words (4,500 characters max) -->

SciPy is an open-source library for scientific computing that has gained
widespread adoption by the scientific community worldwide.
Unfortunately, the SciPy website is only accessible in English, which may
limit its accessibility to Spanish-speaking users.
To ensure that everyone has equal access to this valuable tool, we're proposing
a project to translate the SciPy main website into Spanish.
The goal of this project is to promote diversity and inclusion by making the
site accessible to Spanish-speaking audiences who might not be fluent in
English.
By breaking down language barriers, we're making it easier for Spanish-speaking
scientists to access valuable information, learn new skills, and advance their
careers By doing so, it can expand the reach fields.

The translation process will involve several steps, starting with the
adaptation of a style guide and the creation of a glossary to ensure
consistency throughout the translation.
Next, we will extract the website content (link to the directories or specify
their names) and upload it to Crowdin, a translation management platform.

Once the translation is complete, we will begin the revision process to ensure
the quality of the translation, verifying that the style guide is being used
correctly to unify terminology and adhere to Spanish grammatical rules.

Finally, the translated content will be added to the SciPy repository in a new
directory.
We will also generate the necessary layout to enable users to switch between
languages on the website.
All final changes will be submitted to SciPy via a pull request.

To carry out this project, we will need a team of 4 people, including a web
developer, 2 translators, and a person to check the translation.
The entire process is estimated to take approximately 55 hours of work.

## Please explain the benefit of this proposal including:

**Impact to the project**

Translating the SciPy website can have a significant impact on the accessibility
of this library in the scientific Spanish-speaking community.
It can also attract more Spanish-speaking contributors, diversifying the
community and bringing new perspectives and ideas to the project.

**Impact to the Scientific Ecosystem**

Translating the SciPy website to Spanish can make these tools more accessible to
Spanish-speaking researchers and practitioners in STEM.
Additionally, making these tools more accessible can
help promote diversity and inclusion in the scientific ecosystem, leading to a
more equitable and collaborative scientific community.
This can help increase the Latin scientific research, which can lead to new
discoveries, innovations, and applications in a wide range of fields.

**Impact to the Community**

This translation can have a positive impact on the Spanish-speaking community
at large.
It can help increase access to resources and tools for learning and working
with scientific computing and data analysis, which can help advance education
and career opportunities for Spanish-speaking individuals in STEM.

<!-- persona va a traducir 300 palabras por hora. -->

## Timeline of Deliverables:

<!-- Please include specific timelines showing when you will achieve the proposed work. -->

The translation project will be completed in a two-week timeline, with various
tasks assigned to each day.
In the first week, day one will focus on workflow planning and coordination,
including the adaptation of the style guide and creation of a glossary.

Day two of the first week will involve the extraction of the content to be
translated, while days three to five will be dedicated to content translation.

The second week of the project will continue with days one and two allocated
to content translation.
Day three will be reserved for the review and quality control of the
translation, ensuring that the style guide is followed correctly and that
Spanish grammatical rules are applied appropriately.

The final days of the project, days four and five of week two, will be
dedicated to the deployment of the translation to the website.
