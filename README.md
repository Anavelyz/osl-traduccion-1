## Proposal Title:

Breaking down language barriers: Spanish translation of the main Project
SciPy website

## Two Sentence Summary of Proposal:

To improve the accessibility of SciPy for Spanish-speaking users, we would
like to translate its main website into Spanish.

## Description of Proposal:

<!-- No more than 750 words (4,500 characters max) -->

SciPy is a well-established open-source library for scientific computing,
providing a wide range of tools for numerical methods, optimization, signal
processing, statistics, and more.
As a community-driven project, SciPy has gained widespread adoption and
recognition among the scientific and engineering communities worldwide.

However, the SciPy website is currently only available in English, which may
hinder its accessibility and impact for Spanish-speaking users who might not
be fluent in English. This language barrier could prevent many potential
users from accessing valuable resources, learning new skills, and expanding
their opportunities.

To address this issue, we propose a collaborative project between SciPy and
Open Science Labs to translate the main SciPy website into Spanish. The main
goal of this project is to promote diversity and inclusion by making the
SciPy resources accessible to a wider audience, regardless of their linguistic
background.

The translation process will involve several steps, starting with the
adaptation of a style guide and the creation of a glossary to ensure
consistency and accuracy throughout the translation. Next, we will extract
the website content and work with a team of two expert translators to perform
the translation and adaptation of the content.

We will also have a dedicated person to check the translations and ensure that
the style guide and grammatical rules are being followed correctly. This
person will also provide feedback and suggestions to improve the overall
quality of the translation.

Once the translation is complete, we will proceed to the revision process
and make sure that the translated content meets the required quality standards.
Finally, we will upload the translated content to a new directory in the SciPy
repository, generate the necessary layout to enable users to switch between
languages on the website, and submit a pull request to SciPy for approval.

To carry out this project, we will need a team of four people, including a
web developer, two expert translators, and a language checker. Open Science
Labs will provide the necessary resources and tools to manage the translation
process, as well as technical support to ensure a smooth collaboration with
SciPy.

The estimated time for the entire project is approximately 55 hours of work,
including translation, quality assurance, technical implementation, and
communication with the SciPy team. By collaborating on this project, we can
create a more inclusive and diverse community of users, and enable
Spanish-speaking scientists to access valuable resources and tools that can
help them advance their research and careers.

## Please explain the benefit of this proposal including:

<!-- No more than 400 words (2,500 characters max) -->

**Impact to the project**

Translating the SciPy website can have a significant impact on the accessibility
of this library in the scientific Spanish-speaking community.
It can also attract more Spanish-speaking contributors, diversifying the
community and bringing new perspectives and ideas to the project.

**Impact to the Scientific Ecosystem**

Translating the SciPy website to Spanish can make these tools more accessible to
Spanish-speaking researchers and practitioners in STEM.
Additionally, making these tools more accessible can
help promote diversity and inclusion in the scientific ecosystem, leading to a
more equitable and collaborative scientific community.
This can help increase the Latin scientific research, which can lead to new
discoveries, innovations, and applications in a wide range of fields.

**Impact to the Community**

This translation can have a positive impact on the Spanish-speaking community
at large.
It can help increase access to resources and tools for learning and working
with scientific computing and data analysis, which can help advance education
and career opportunities for Spanish-speaking individuals in STEM.

<!-- Nota: Se estima que un traductor(a) gane 0.05$ por palabra y que una persona -->
<!-- puede traducir 300-350 palabras por hora. Se asume en este caso, que la -->
<!-- persona va a traducir 300 palabras por hora. -->

## Timeline of Deliverables:

<!-- Please include specific timelines showing when you will achieve the proposed work. -->

The translation project will be completed in a two-week timeline, with various
tasks assigned to each day.
In the first week, day one will focus on workflow planning and coordination,
including the adaptation of the style guide and creation of a glossary.

Day two of the first week will involve the extraction of the content to be
translated, while days three to five will be dedicated to content translation.

The second week of the project will continue with days one and two allocated
to content translation.
Day three will be reserved for the review and quality control of the
translation, ensuring that the style guide is followed correctly and that
Spanish grammatical rules are applied appropriately.

The final days of the project, days four and five of week two, will be
dedicated to the deployment of the translation to the website.

Throughout this entire process, the individual responsible for protocol and
project planning shall diligently execute their role. They will proficiently
orchestrate and facilitate meetings and encounters among stakeholders,
meticulously review materials, and proficiently undertake additional
activities essential to the project's success.
