# Description of Proposal:

<!-- No more than 750 words (4,500 characters max) -->

The goal of this proposal is to increase the accessibility of the SciPy main
website for Spanish-speaking audiences who may not be fluent in English.
SciPy is an open-source library for scientific computing that has gained
widespread adoption by the scientific community worldwide.
However, the SciPy website is currently only available in English, which may
limit its accessibility to Spanish-speaking users.
To address this issue, this proposal outlines a plan to translate the SciPy
main website into Spanish.

Translating the SciPy website to Spanish can promote diversity and inclusion in
the scientific ecosystem and community. By doing so, it can expand the reach
and accessibility of SciPy and its tools to a wider audience, which can enhance
education and career opportunities for Spanish-speaking individuals in STEM
fields.

- Explain how we will made the translation
- How much time we need to do it?
- How many people?

# Please explain the benefit of this proposal including:

<!-- -Impact to the community -->
<!-- No more than 400 words (2,500 characters max) -->

## Impact to the project:

Translating the SciPy website can have a significant impact on the accessibility
of this library in the scientific Spanish-speaking community.
It can also attract more Spanish-speaking contributors, diversifying the
community and bringing new perspectives and ideas to the project.

## Impact to the Scientific Ecosystem:

Translating the SciPy website to Spanish can make these tools more accessible to
Spanish-speaking researchers and practitioners in STEM.
Additionally, making these tools more accessible can
help promote diversity and inclusion in the scientific ecosystem, leading to a
more equitable and collaborative scientific community.
This can help increase the Latin scientific research, which can lead to new
discoveries, innovations, and applications in a wide range of fields.

## Impact to the Community:

<!-- What community? General community or Scipy community? -->

This translation can have a positive impact on the Spanish-speaking community
at large.
It can help increase access to resources and tools for learning and working
with scientific computing and data analysis, which can help advance education
and career opportunities for Spanish-speaking individuals in STEM.
